/**
 * This class simulates a static reliability model using the same network as for 
 * the specific San13 example with 9 nodes and 13 links, taken from Elmaghraby (1977).
 * The goal here is to estimate the probability that nodes 1 and 9 are disconnected.
 * This program is very specific to this example and uses a very naive way to
 * compute the shortest path, by enumerating all six paths!
 * Here the links are numbered from 0 to 12.
